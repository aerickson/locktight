locktight
=========

Lock your Mac with a keyboard shortcut

## Troubleshooting
- when locking, if the screen dims and then the desktop reappears (vs locking):
  - go to the "Security & Privacy" preference pane
  - under the "General" tab, check "Require password' and select 'immediately'
    - anything other than 'immediately' will make LockTight not work
- uninstall any previous versions of LockTight you may have installed
